I added some of my projects to the project page:

- **Interactive Visual Data Analysis:** C++/DirectX tool for rendering of scientific volume data sets.
- **VR Exploration:** The results of my bachelor's thesis. A framework for Oculus Rift and Leap Motion for VR movement of data sets.
- **Into Darkness:** Detailed information on what I worked on during the Into Darkness project.

I also added some information on other projects. However for those I have not
yet wrote a complete article. More will come later.

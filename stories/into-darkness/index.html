<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This was the first project I worked on that we developed from scratch without
using a game engine. The game had to be finished in one semester including the
concept phase, the development as well as user testing. More details about how
my experiences during development can be found in this blog post.</p>
<p>The game was developed in C++ with DirectX11 for the rendering.
We used Blender and GIMP to create the assets for the game.
It was for <a class="reference external" href="http://wwwcg.in.tum.de/teaching/teaching/summer-term-15/computer-games-laboratory.html">this</a>
practical course.</p>
<p>Some of the stuff I worked on during the project were the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Concept</li>
<li>Paper prototype</li>
<li>Basic engine framework</li>
<li>Level architecture</li>
<li>Procedural level generation</li>
<li>Character interaction</li>
<li>Level loading</li>
<li>Asset creation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>
<div class="section" id="concept">
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>The initial concept for our game was for the player to search abandoned
underground facilities on a planet where all life is underground. The player
should have to fight against aliens and gather as much resources as possible
without dying. Because of the underground setting light should play an important
role, both as a means for attack as well as defense. Because we did not have
artists in our team I did most of the concept art. Some of it can be seen below:</p>
<img alt="/images/into-darkness/concept.png" src="../../images/into-darkness/concept.png"><p>Our idea of the aliens was that they would live underground and be very sensitive
to light. This should be used as an advantage to the player by scaring them off
or changing the layout of the level through lighting areas. The amount of aliens
would also increase when venturing deeper into the levels and the would become more aggressive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paper-prototype">
<h3>Paper prototype</h3>
<p>We had the task to create a paper prototype for our game. Because the game would
be played in real time we had to somehow represent the actions like shooting and
walking around in our paper prototype. To achieve this, we changed the game to
be turn based. The player and the aliens both had a certain amount of actions
per round. To recreate the exploring of the base we created room modules
that would be connected while the player was walking through the level.</p>
<p>The goal for the player was to collect as much money as possible and
reach the starting point of the level again without being killed by the aliens.</p>
<img alt="/images/into-darkness/paper-prototype.jpeg" src="../../images/into-darkness/paper-prototype.jpeg">
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-engine-framework">
<h3>Basic engine framework</h3>
<p>As a reference for the basic engine structure I used the book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gameenginebook.com/">Game Engine Architecture.</a>
It covers most subsystems needed to create a game. The first things I developed
were a simple renderer with DirectX that would render 3D meshes. As a file format we used .obj.</p>
<p>After this I implemented the user interactions through keyboard and mouse as well as the iso camera.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-architecture">
<h3>Level architecture</h3>
<p>After the rendering was working in principle I started with how to store our
levels for the game. Because the camera is attached to the player all the time
and the iso perspective cannot be changed during the game we only have to see a
small part of the actual level. As a structure for the level I used a quad tree
and only loaded the chunks nearest to the player into memory. During gameplay a
buffer of three by three chunks was allocated. When the player was moving around,
new chunks would be loaded into this rectangle based on the movement direction
and overwrite the no longer needed chunks. On the resulting chunks
I performed frustum culling to determine which should be rendered.</p>
<p>Because the player cannot jump or climb in our game he only moves in two dimensions.
To perform collision detection, we used a height map for each chunk indicating
whether the player could walk on this position or not.</p>
<p>Each chunk also had the information for the mesh instances that should
be rendered. We used instanced rendering for most of the level geometry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedural-level-generation">
<h3>Procedural level generation</h3>
<p>We decided from the beginning against creating levels by hand for two reasons:
First we would have needed to create a level editor. Second we wanted
to work on programming rather than designing levels.</p>
<p>For the creation of the levels I decided to do it using rectangular rooms that
would be connected by corridors and could vary in size. I used agent based
dungeon growing. The idea behind this is to start the agent at one point and
then go in random directions and try to add rooms. The rooms were connected by
narrow corridors. Through this the level would grow from the inside and would
be denser in the middle. After the creation was finished the rooms had to
be split up into the level chunks to be loaded correctly on runtime.</p>
<img alt="/images/into-darkness/level-geometry.png" src="../../images/into-darkness/level-geometry.png">
</div>
<div class="section" id="character-interaction">
<h3>Character interaction</h3>
<p>For our game we needed the ability for the player to pick up objects that are
placed in the level. Also it should be possible to interact with various other
objects like generators or doors in the level.</p>
<p>To realize this, I expanded on the collision height field and stored information
for possible interactions at the current position in addition to the collision
information. When pressing E, the player code would check the value at the current
position and perform the required action.</p>
<p>For the other interactions with the level rooms had to have power for the doors
to work. To do this, generators could be powered on by using a battery.
After this it was possible to open and close doors and the light would be powered on.</p>
<p>The generators and items were placed randomly in the levels. I had to expand my
procedural level generation code to do this. Additional care had to be taken to
define which rooms where powered by which generators. Also I had to implement a
graph structure for the whole level with the rooms as nodes and the edges as the
corridors which was used for the artificial intelligence of the aliens.</p>
<img alt="/images/into-darkness/shooting.png" src="../../images/into-darkness/shooting.png">
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-loading">
<h3>Level loading</h3>
<p>The starting point for the player is a central elevator that connects all
levels of the current map. From here he can return to his base of operation or
go to deeper levels.</p>
<p>If the player selects a different level from the elevator the chunks have to be
loaded. To perform this, I simply marked all current chunks as old and added the
new chunks to the list of chunks that needed to be loaded.</p>
<p>After I added the items to the level and the interactions with doors and
generators I had to save the modifications to the levels both during gameplay
and after restarting the game. To do this I saved all the modifications per chunk
and if the corresponding chunk was removed from the chunk buffer I saved these in
a separate file. When reloading this chunk, I would check if such a file exists
and overwrite the state of the loaded chunk with the modified information.</p>

<div class="section" id="asset-creation">
<h3>Asset creation</h3>
<p>Because we had no artist during this project I did most of the placeholder
assets for the game which can be seen here:</p>

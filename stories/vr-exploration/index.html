<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In my thesis I worked on creating a framework that would add support for Oculus
Rift and Leap Motion into existing 3D Rendering applications.</p>
<p>It was integrated into the project of my supervisor which can be found
<a class="reference external" href="href=%22http:/wwwcg.in.tum.de/research/research/publications/2013/visualization-of-big-sph-simulations-via-compressed-octree-grids.html%22">here.</a></p>
<p>The user is able to move and rotate the datasets using both hands by grabbing them.
I also performed user testing to compare my interaction method to the more
traditional mouse and keyboard input scheme.</p>

<div class="section" id="details">
<h2>Details</h2>
<div class="section" id="concept">
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>The idea was that the user could look around using the Oculus Rift. Depending
on the dataset loaded we wanted to create different experiences. For example, for the
visualization of the <a class="reference external" href="href=%22http:/wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/%22">millennium run project</a>
the user should be inside a huge volume. For others like the
<a class="reference external" href="%22https:/www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html%22">visual human project</a>
the data set should have approximately real life size.</p>
<p>For the interaction with the data we wanted to create an intuitive and natural way
to manipulate the datasets using the Leap Motion.</p>

<div class="section" id="application">
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>I first started with integrating oculus rift support into the application. This proved
to be harder than expected because the rendering had to be changed to create the images correctly.
It was especially important to have the same level of detail for both eyes. Because
the performed raytracing was dependent on the eye position we had the problem that
the images would be correctly positioned to be perceived as 3D but were slightly
different. To prevent this some parts of the rendering process were performed with
a centered positon between both eyes.</p>
<p>Another problem we faced I faced was the general performance. Especially for the larger
datasets like the millennium run the performance was around fifteen fps. Fortunately
it was possible to reduce the quality of rendering quite a bit before it was noticeable
to the user. This was mainly due to the abstract visualization where faults would not
be noticeable.</p>
<p>For the interaction with the Leap Motion I tested different versions. The one which
we decided on in the end was to grab the data sets with one hand and rotate them with both.
This turned out to be the most robust version. Others which used more specialized gestures
had the problem that the Leap Motion data was not consistent enough to create a
good experience.</p>
<p>Both the SDKs for Leap Motion and Oculus Rift were still heavily in development
during the thesis. Some of the changes to the SDKs were a huge improvement especially
the new hand models for the Leap Motion. However, it also resulted in a lot of code
for the abstraction of the Oculus Rift which became obsolete after the newest SDK
was released.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-testing">
<h3>User Testing</h3>
<p>After the implementation I decide with my supervisor to conduct a series of user test
to see how good the Leap Motion and Oculus Rift performed. We especially choose people
without much or any experience with virtual reality. This was quite important because
I had become quite resistant to motion sickness while debugging my application.
The test consisted of two parts with Oculus Rift. In one the participant used the
mouse and keyboard to navigate. In the other the Leap Motion was used. The tests were
performed in different order for each participant to prevent the Oculus Rift influencing
the results. Each participant had to perform the same task which was to navigate through
the visual human dataset.</p>
